I set up a demo account for a quick tour of the website. Some features are disabled or may not work as expected. It is just to give you a feel of the website.
The backend is not deployed, you can run the backend and frontend locally by following the instructions in the submodules.

Or, try it out with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/spaceflight-cosmologist-42752282/workspace/budget-manager/overview)
